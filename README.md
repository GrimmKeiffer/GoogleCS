- Wireshark

## Steps
1 ![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fc9522a-318d-4a19-ad9c-eb385585c846)
- Applied NIST framework to a simulated security event
- Summarized in report form based on event described
- Identified the initial issues
- Reported security teams implemented solution
- Verified how team detected incident
- Documented teams response going forward as a lessons learned
- Identified the teams recovery status and implementation

2 ![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7bf7cac-bfd1-4aab-8f30-e4966e1dad4c)
- Performed a security risk assessment based on a simulated event
- provided 3 hardening solutions that fit the situation and information provided
- further detailed reasoning for solutions selected

3 ![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be4d0e44-8649-4ede-b176-11a9df68a82b)
- Identified attack type that caused network interuption based on simulated event with provided information
- Explained how the attack is performed
- Further detailed the result of attack and how it is affecting the network usage

4 ![4-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0647b84-c1d3-4312-96bf-e4129a0bf7c5)
- Identified controls in place or not in place based on simulated event

4.2 ![4-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fede2f45-bb40-43df-80d0-d308e4de2be8)
- Continued from event above
- Performed PCI DSS compliance checklist
- Provided checklist baseed on simulated event with provided details

4.3 ![4-3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/238f128e-fd96-4d97-bcf4-6e87dfb83abb)
- Continued from event above

4.4 ![4-4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/669daf9b-b2e6-4089-99f6-7fd4c54e5a93)
- Continued from event above
- Performed System and organizational controls checklist based off details from simulated event

5 ![5-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2f694b5-979d-4dff-bd03-e61755a5f9a1)
- Based on a simulated event with provided details of event
- Identified the network protocol involved with the incident
- Verified with additional tool (TCPdump)

5.2 ![5-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08a27604-5cde-4f2a-aad5-0c05891a2edf)
- Continuing from event above
- Documented the incident starting with customer contact to helpdesk
- Sandboxed the issue to verify the incident and confirm results
- Inspection of TCPdump for second layer verification
- Summary of results including the theory of attacker injections

5.3 ![5-3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edb5e4e3-140f-41ff-ae22-0d258f081c39)
- Continued from event above
- Recommended solutions for deterring the same attack in the future
- Password complexity  and changes recommended to prevent this same issue from recurring
